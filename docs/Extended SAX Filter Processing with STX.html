    SAX for the Ignorant

  * Simple API for XML
  * Event-based parser API
  * Push model

    The Simple API for XML (SAX) enables the processing of XML data as a
    stream. A SAX producer generates events that correspond to XML
    markup, a SAX consumer processes such events. In most of the cases
    the SAX producer is an XML Parser (an |XMLReader| object) and the
    SAX consumer is an application that wants to read and process XML
    encoded data.

      SAX Filters

  * Event producer doesn't have to be an XML parser;
    it could be
      o any application that produces XML data
      o any specialized parser that provides an XML view to non-XML data
  * Event consumer might in turn emit SAX events
    (it acts as a SAX filter)

    There are many more potential applications on the producer side. Any
    software that wants to provide an XML view on its data might decide
    to produce SAX events instead of generating a well-formed XML file
    as a byte stream (which in turn would have to be parsed on the
    consumer side). In addition, transformation tools that read a
    proprietary data format and turn it into SAX events enable all kinds
    of XML processing for non-XML data. 

    A special type of a SAX processing participant is a SAX filter
    component. A filter acts as consumer and producer simultaneously.
    The consumed events could be modified, removed, or used for creating
    a completely new set of events. Using this technology, a filter
    chain could easily be established, in which the first producer is
    often an XML parser and the last consumer is often an XML serializer
    that creates an XML document from the event stream. The Cocoon
    framework for example uses this technology to create processing
    pipelines. 

*Filter chain:*

      SAX-Based Transformations?

  * requires low-level programming
  * programmer needs to maintain state, namespaces, etc
  * laborious to create XML

    There are several ways to implement the single components of this
    pipeline (the individual filter objects). Using the SAX interfaces
    directly on the Java level requires low-level SAX programming. This
    could be a small barrier to non-experienced programmers. While
    simple tasks may be relatively easy to solve, it gets more
    complicated for a filter mechanism that needs to keep track of the
    current context in the event stream. Last but not least, creating
    SAX output events in a filter scenario requires a great deal of
    attention to detail. 


*A deterrent example:*
add an |id| attribute that belongs to a special namespace

// /"declare" the additional namespace before a startElement()/
handler.startPrefixMapping("ex", "http://www.example.com");

// /within the implementation of startElement(uri, lName, qName, atts)/
AttributesImpl newAtts = new AttributesImpl(atts);
newAtts.addAttribute("http://www.example.com", "id", "ex:id",
                     "CDATA", String.valueOf(count++));
handler.startElement(uri, lName, qName, newAtts);

// /"undeclare" the additional namespace after the proper endElement()/
handler.endPrefixMapping("ex");

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Luckily ...*

  * the W3C invented the XML transformation language XSLT
  * JAXP 1.1 (Java API for XML Processing) provides a SAX interface to
    XSLT transformations:

    The solution for more complex filter algorithms would be the use of
    special transformation components, for example an XSLT engine (in
    fact there is no difference between a filter and an XML transformer
    from the user's perspective). The Java interfaces for XSLT in the
    JAXP 1.1 (Java API for XML Processing) specification include a
    special SAX package (|javax.xml.transform.sax|) that enables the
    chain-linking of several transformer objects into a SAX filter
    pipeline. 

TransformerFactory tFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
SAXTransformerFactory saxTFactory = (SAXTransformerFactory) tFactory;
// */create two XSLT transformer objects/
TransformerHandler tHandler1 = 
    saxTFactory.newTransformerHandler(new StreamSource("step1.xsl"));
TransformerHandler tHandler2 = 
    saxTFactory.newTransformerHandler(new StreamSource("step2.xsl"));*
XMLReader myReader = XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader();
ContentHandler mySerializer = ...

// */create a transformation chain/
myReader.setContentHandler(tHandler1);*
myReader.setProperty("http://xml.org/sax/properties/lexical-handler", 
                     tHandler1);*
tHandler1.setResult(new SAXResult(tHandler2));
tHandler2.setResult(new SAXResult(mySerializer));*

// /run the transformation/
myReader.parse("input.xml");

    A |SAXTransformerFactory| creates two handler objects. One uses the
    XSLT instructions in the file step1.xsl, the other one uses the file
    step2.xsl. A |TransformerHandler| is a sub-interface of
    |ContentHandler|, so it can be registered at an |XMLReader| object.
    In this scenario |tHandler1| acts as the consumer for the |myReader|
    object. Then |tHandler2| is registered as a consumer (result object)
    for |tHandler1|, and finally |mySerializer| consumes the output from
    |tHandler2|. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*But ...*

the use of XSLT prevents real stream processing

  * XSLT/XPath needs an in-memory representation of the whole document.
  * The transformation won't start before the last event has been consumed.
  * This is inappropriate for large XML documents.

    The drawback of XSLT is that it does not process its input as a
    stream. Rather, it consumes the incoming SAX events completely,
    creates an in-memory tree representation of the data, performs the
    transformation into a result tree, and then afterwards produces SAX
    events for this result. XSLT is tree-oriented by design, it is build
    on top of XPath. This characteristic will be problematic for
    memory-intensive cases, that means for SAX streams that represent
    large XML documents. If only one component of a pipeline needs a
    tree-oriented XML representation (like XSLT), the whole data flow
    within the pipeline would be accumulated in this component before
    the next one starts its processing.

      SAX or XSLT? – STX!

STX = Streaming Transformations for XML
http://stx.sourceforge.net/

    STX (Streaming Transformations for XML) [1] offers a solution for
    this memory problem. STX is built directly on SAX; it processes its
    input without building an internal tree representation. STX enables
    a streaming processing that resembles XSLT on the syntactic level. 

    STX was introduced in an article on xml.com [2] and at the XML
    Europe 2003 conference in London [3]. 

  * processes a stream of SAX events

  * doesn't build an internal tree representation of the document

  * resembles XSLT on the syntactic level:
      o XML document that contains templates
      o templates will be matched using patterns
      o mix of instructions and literal result elements
      o STXPath very similar to XPath, but no explicit axes

  * uses a strict forward processing model

------------------------------------------------------------------------
9 / 23


      A Simple STX Example

/Modify the input by adding a consecutive ID attribute to certain
elements (footnotes that appear within chapters)./

<stx:transform xmlns:stx="http://stx.sourceforge.net/2002/ns"
               xmlns:ex="http://www.example.com/"
               version="1.0" pass-through="all">
      
  <stx:variable name="count" select="1" />
      
  <stx:template match="chapter//footnote">
    <stx:copy attributes="@*">
      <stx:attribute name="ex:id" select="$count" />
      <stx:assign name="count" select="$count + 1" />
      <stx:process-children />
    </stx:copy>
  </stx:template>
      
</stx:transform>


*STX combines SAX processing with the XSLT syntax.*

    Using STX removes the burden of keeping track of the current context
    (the ancestors, the position among siblings, and the namespaces in
    scope) from the programmer and makes it very easy to create XML
    output. Nevertheless, complex transformations that need more than
    the actual ancestor list are still difficult to develop in a pure
    streaming scenario. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
10 / 23


      Java and STX?

    The good thing from the Java programmer's point of view is that the
    API side is already familiar. The Java-based STX implementation
    Joost [4] enables an STX transformation via the JAXP 1.1 interfaces
    discussed above. That means using Joost as STX engine within a Java
    application requires only a tiny bit of configuration. Switching
    from XSLT to STX is trivial. Moreover, using STX in existing
    applications as for example Cocoon is just as simple. 

STX /is/ a transformation language, that means STX can be used via JAXP
just as XSLT.

Using the Java-based implementation Joost:

// /use Joost as transformation engine/*
System.setProperty("javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory",
                   "net.sf.joost.trax.TransformerFactoryImpl");*

// /the remaining code is known area/
TransformerFactory tFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
SAXTransformerFactory saxTFactory = (SAXTransformerFactory) tFactory;

// /of course the transformation source must be different/
TransformerHandler tHandler1 = 
    saxTFactory.newTransformerHandler(new StreamSource("*trans.stx*"));
...
myReader.setContentHandler(tHandler1);
myReader.setProperty("http://xml.org/sax/properties/lexical-handler", 
                     tHandler1);
tHandler1.setResult(new SAXResult(tHandler2));
...

    From the Java point of view, the |TransformerHandler| object is
    simply a "black box" that does the XML transformation somehow and
    that has a standardized interface. Switching to STX simply means:
    use a different black box. 

    [Note: This example shows that a future JAXP version should provide
    an intermediate level for specifying the kind of transformation.
    Currently without the property for a TransformerFactory the Java
    runtime system instantiates a default factory (which should be able
    to create XSLT transformers). Using STX requires the class name of
    an STX transformer factory. However, it is not possible to request a
    "default" STX transformer without knowing a concrete implementation.]

      XSLT and STX: Two Extremes (!)

    In the current situation one has to choose between the streaming
    approach (SAX, STX) and the full tree approach (DOM, XSLT). Both
    extremes seem to be inadequate for non-trivial transformations of
    large documents. 

XSLT 	STX
Full in-memory representation of the document 	Ancestor stack
Random access to all data in the document 	Only current node and its
ancestors accessible

/a book/ 	/a reading/

*Is there a compromise?*
Use a hybrid transformation approach.

Split the document into fragments. Transform each fragment with XSLT (or
any other tree-oriented transformation).

/a chapter-wise tape-record of a long reading/

    A possible solution is to use a hybrid approach that reads a SAX
    stream, identifies smaller pieces (XML fragments), and passes these
    fragments to a tree-oriented application. By this means the new
    scenario describes not a linear pipeline, but rather a flow with
    laterally connected transformation components. Technically, each
    component is just a common SAX filter that may build an in-memory
    tree representation of the fragment. The component itself doesn't
    take notice of its special usage. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
12 / 23

*Using a splitter component*

The splitter passes the fragments to independent transformers.

<http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~obecker/Docs/EML2003/flow3.svg>

    (This graphic is linked to an animated SVG. The animation starts by
    clicking into this SVG.) 

  * non-linear transformation
  * completely SAX-based, uses standard SAX interfaces
  * /Filter 2/ doesn't take notice of its special usage

    STX provides a simple interface to these external SAX filters. As
    you will see in a moment, this interface is completely independent
    from the implementation of such an external filter. 

    [Technical detail: the SAX event stream for the fragment should be
    enclosed in a |startDocument| / |endDocument| event pair, as well as
    |startPrefixMapping| / |endPrefixMapping| events for all namespaces
    that are in scope at the start of the fragment.] 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
13 / 23

*STX can be used to split a document*

    Before I explain the details, I will say a few words about STX's
    general processing model. STX processes SAX events, i.e. it
    processes an XML document in document order. In XSLT, the
    instruction to process other parts of the input (other nodes) is
    |xsl:apply-templates|. While |xsl:apply-templates| is able to
    process arbitrary nodes of the input tree, an analogous STX
    instruction can only process nodes that follow the current node. To
    this end STX provides several individual instructions. 

*Idea:* extend the |stx:process-|... instructions
(STX's replacement for |xsl:apply-templates|)

  * |stx:process-children|
  * |stx:process-attributes|
  * |stx:process-self|
  * |stx:process-siblings|
  * (|stx:process-buffer|)
  * (|stx:process-document|)

	

    STX has buffers: FIFO (first in first out) stores for SAX events. A
    temporary result of an STX transformation can be stored in a buffer
    and then processed again using the |stx:process-buffer| instruction.

    With the exception of |stx:process-attributes| each of these
    instructions addresses an XML fragment that is subject of the
    following processing steps. While normally the templates of the STX
    transformation sheet do this processing, it is easy to extend the
    instructions above to direct the selected fragment to an external
    SAX filter. 

Every instruction addresses an XML fragment that can be passed to an
external SAX filter component
(except for |stx:process-attributes|)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

      How to Identify the External Filter?

    To address the the external SAX filter, one needs an identification
    of the filter and possibly a source for special filter instructions.
    In the case of XSLT we need to express that an XSLT transformer is
    required and which stylesheet has to be used. 

We need

  * a unique name for the filter (implementation-independent)
  * possibly a source for the filter instructions

The web-typical solution for a unique name: a *URI*


*See*: extension functions in XSLT

Bad solution (depends on a Java implementation)

<xsl:value-of select="date:new()"
              xmlns:date="*java:java.util.Date*" />

Good solution (EXSLT)

<xsl:value-of select="date:date-time()"
              xmlns:date="*http://exslt.org/dates-and-times*" />

    In this examples the first invocation of |xsl:value-of| presumably
    works only in a Java-based implementation of the XSLT processor,
    because it directly addresses a method in a Java class. The second
    example uses an extension function whose specification is defined
    independent of an underlying programming language. Thus every XSLT
    processor should be able to provide an implementation of this function.

    The same approach is used to identify an external filter: it doesn't
    address the implementation, but uses a URI that every STX engine can
    map to its specific implementation of the filter. (/It's all about
    indirection in XML!/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
15 / 23


      Filter URIs

Do we have to invent new URIs for all kinds of SAX filters?

*No, some do have already canonical names:*

  * XSLT:
    *|http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform|*

  * STX:
    *|http://stx.sourceforge.net/2002/ns|*

  * XML Signature:
    *|http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#|*

  * SAX:
    *|http://xml.org/sax|*

    If some transformation approach belongs to a specified namespace,
    this namespace should be used to identify the filter. Of course it
    is possible to extend this URI list for all kinds of specialized
    filters.

    The SAX filter listed above is meant as a transformer that consumes
    text as a (series of) |characters| events and emits SAX events from
    parsing this text. This is useful for unparsed XML content, for
    example from within a CDATA section.

    In the end it is up to the STX engine to recognize a filter URI and
    to identify and resolve a proper implementation for that filter. The
    STX function |filter-available()| can be used to check whether a
    requested filter is available or not. On the STX level, there's no
    implementation-specific knowledge necessary (for example a Java
    class name); this extended filter interface is portable and
    implementation-independent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
16 / 23


      Filter Sources

Some filters need additional filter instructions
(for example an XSLT stylesheet)

*Two ways for specifying a source:*

  * reference to an external resource
    |*url(/link/)*|
    necessary if the source is non-XML data

  * source is the contents of an STX buffer
    |*buffer(/buffer-name/)*|
    requires that the filter accepts SAX events for its initialization

    The specification of a filter source is possible by reference, using
    the "|url(...)|" syntax already known from several W3C documents
    (namely CSS and XSLFO), and inline with the help of an STX buffer,
    using the "|buffer(...)|" notation. This second variant enables
    self-containing transformation sheets, provided the source is XML
    that can be passed to the filter as a SAX event stream. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
17 / 23

*Two attributes for |stx:process-|...*

  * *|filter-method|*
    specifies the URI that identifies the transformation
  * *|filter-src|*
    specifies the source for the transformation instructions

Parameters are passed using the familiar syntax:


<stx:process-children
        *filter-method="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
        filter-src="url('sorter.xsl')"*>
   <stx:with-param name="attrname" select="'size'" />
</stx:process-children>


means:   	/Transform the children of the current node with the XSLT
stylesheet 'sorter.xsl' and pass the string '|size|' as value for the
stylesheet parameter |attrname|./

------------------------------------------------------------------------
18 / 23


      Inline XSLT Stylesheets in STX

With the help of buffers it is possible to describe an STX
transformation that uses an XSLT process within one source file:

*<stx:buffer name="xslt-code">*
  <xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
                  version="1.0">
    <xsl:param name="par" />
    <xsl:template match="/">
       ...
    </xsl:template>
    ...
  </xsl:stylesheet>
</stx:buffer>

<stx:template match="foo">
  <stx:process-self
          filter-method="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"*
          filter-src="buffer(xslt-code)"*>
    <stx:with-param name="par" select="123" />
  </stx:process-self>
</stx:template>

------------------------------------------------------------------------
19 / 23


      Inline Code for External Transformations

    From the STX point of view, the contents of a buffer is simply XML
    data. That means the buffer contents can be created or modified by
    STX template rules or again with the help of an external SAX filter.

This technique allows transformations that modify their source
dynamically prior to its usage!

The meta-information for the transformation could be located

  * in another document
  * at the start of the document

<magic>
  <head>
    <important path="*charm[2]/@spell*" />
    <important path="*charm[4]/@spell*" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <charm spell="Abracadabra">???</charm>
    <charm spell="Obliviate">
             Modifies or erases portions of a person's memory.</charm>
    <charm spell="Peskipiksi Pesternomi">Freezing Charm?</charm>
    <charm spell="Wingardium Leviosa">
             Causes a feather to levitate.</charm>
  </body>
</magic>

    In this example the transformation has to extract the information
    that is specified in the |path| attribute of the |head/important|
    elements. Using pure XSLT this is impossible, or at least very
    difficult (unless of course one uses for example such magic
    functions like Saxon's |evaluate|).

    Using the |stx:process-buffer| approach, STX can transform the
    |head| element into transformation instructions, store these in a
    buffer, and apply the contents of this buffer afterwards to the
    |body| part of the document, see magic.xml
    <http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~obecker/Docs/EML2003/magic.xml> and
    magic.stx
    <http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~obecker/Docs/EML2003/magic.stx>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

      A Proof of Concept: Schematron via STX

    A more real life example is the XSLT-based implementation of
    Schematron [5]. Using this pure XSLT approach one has to transform
    the Schematron schema into a validating stylesheet. After this step
    this stylesheet can be applied to an XML document, which should
    conform to the Schematron schema. It is not possible in this
    implementation to apply the schema directly to the document. This
    might appear strange to less experienced users.

    Since the validating stylesheet is a temporary file that results
    directly from the Schematron schema, it can be computed dynamically
    and stored in a buffer. The following graphic demonstrates this
    approach.

<http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~obecker/Docs/EML2003/schematron-stx.svg>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Schematron via STX: the Code

<stx:transform xmlns:stx="http://stx.sourceforge.net/2002/ns"
               version="1.0">

  <stx:param name="schema" required="yes" />

  <stx:buffer name="schematron">
    <stx:process-document
            filter-src="url('schematron-basic.xsl')"
            filter-method="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
            href="$schema" />
  </stx:buffer>
  
  <stx:template match="/">
    <stx:process-self
            filter-src="buffer(schematron)"
            filter-method="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" />
  </stx:template>

</stx:transform>

    The contents of the buffer "schematron" is the result of applying an
    XSLT transformation on the Schematron schema. This transformation
    produces a validating XSLT stylesheet which will be applied to the
    input stream of the STX process afterwards. Using only XSLT and the
    metastylesheet reference implementation "schematron-basic.xsl"
    requires the manual execution of these two steps. 

Invocation:

joost document.xml schematron.stx
<http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~obecker/Docs/EML2003/schematron.stx> schema=val.sch <http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~obecker/Docs/EML2003/val.sch>

    In this example the file |val.sch| is a simple schema that checks if
    the root element of the input document is |stx:transform|. Running
    the example requires the two additional files schematron-basic.xsl
    <http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~obecker/Docs/EML2003/schematron-basic.xsl>
    and skeleton1-5.xsl
    <http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~obecker/Docs/EML2003/skeleton1-5.xsl>
    to be in the working directory.

      Pluggable Filters in Joost

How to provide a custom filter implementation for a URI?

    I've started this presentation with a motivation for SAX filter
    processing. After telling you that special transformation components
    (XSLT and STX-based) might be easier to develop and maintain, and
    that STX moreover allows the splitting of large documents into
    smaller fragments, one last question remains: how can I use existing
    custom filter implementations from an STX engine? 

    Using Joost it is very simple to plug in custom SAX filter
    implementations. The only prerequisites are

      * the filter implementation must support the
        |javax.xml.transform.sax.TransformerHandler| interface
      * the filter implementation must accept a
        |javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXResult| object for sending the
        result SAX event stream to.

    (In the first JAXP example you've seen already both
    |TransformerHandler| and |SAXResult| as participants in a SAX filter
    chain.)

    Actually Joost doesn't need a full implementation for this
    interface. In particular, the |getTransformer()| method won't be
    invoked by Joost, thus it's sufficient to provide an empty method.

    Registering such an implementation works in the same way as the
    familiar approach, when a custom |javax.xml.transform.Source| object
    for an URI appearing in the transformation may be provided via a
    |javax.xml.transform.URIResolver|.

    Joost provides a special |TransformerHandlerResolver| interface for
    resolving |TransformerHandler| objects. Its method |resolve()| will
    be called when an |stx:process-|*** instruction bearing a
    |filter-method| attribute is encountered, passing the filter URI,
    the source specification and the parameters as arguments. It then
    returns either a |TransformerHandler| object, or |null| if such an
    object cannot be created.

 1. The filter has to implement the interface
    *|javax.xml.transform.sax.TransformerHandler|*
 2. The new resolver interface *|TransformerHandlerResolver|* returns a
    filter object (similar to |URIResolver|)

public interface TransformerHandlerResolver
{
   // /invoked for a url(...) source/
   TransformerHandler resolve(String method, String href, String base,
                              Hashtable params)
      throws SAXException;

   // /invoked for a buffer(...) source/
   TransformerHandler resolve(String method, XMLReader reader, 
                              Hashtable params)
      throws SAXException;

   // /implements the STX function filter-available()/
   boolean available(String filter);
}

    Such a resolver can be registered using the |setAttribute| method of
    Joost's |TransformerFactory|, which is again specified already by
    JAXP 1.1.

    This paper has demonstrated that the streaming transformation
    language STX may be used to split a SAX event stream into fragments
    and pass these fragments to other SAX filter components. This
    enables the transformation of very large XML documents that are on
    the one hand too big for XSLT, but on the other hand too complicated
    to transform solely an a stream basis with STX. Splitting the stream
    into fragments allows hybrid techniques, so that each of the
    fragments can be transformed independently, e.g. by an XSLT engine. 

    Furthermore, using the Java-based STX implementation Joost, it is
    very easy to create custom SAX filters that can be invoked from an
    STX transformation. The interface on the STX level is
    language-independent, the interfaces for using Joost are
    standardized in the JAXP 1.1 package. 

    [Closing note: the specification for using external filter
    components described here is currently under revision. Instead of
    sending the result of an external component directly to the current
    result stream, it might be redirected to the input stream. Thus,
    such a filter would act as a preprocessing step for the current
    |stx:process-|*** instruction.]
